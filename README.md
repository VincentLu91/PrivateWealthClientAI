# Private Wealth Client AI Assistant

BLOG POST: https://vincentlu91.github.io/2023/07/28/LLM-Conversational-AI-Assistant.html

This project addresses a use case in which clients seek a better understanding of a marketing brochure before choosing to make a decision, or to seek further information from a service provider. In this case, the LLM-powered AI assistant is trained on a public-facing document about wealth investing services offered by an established bank.

The project is deployed via Streamlit. Link to the project can be found below:
